# VPN-Manager-for-OpenVPN-OpenELEC-LibreELEC-Kodi
You can add up to 10 separate VPN server locations and cycle through them with the click of a button. You can set certain add-ons not to use a VPN.
I recommend using a VPN to help keep yourself anonymous and protect yourself online. You can get 73% off any package from PureVPN which allows you to connect 5 devices to an encrypted VPN connection at any one time.

In the VPN Configuration Window click on VPN Provider and scroll through until you find your VPN Provider
Then under that enter the Username and Password for your VPN Provider Select the VPN Connections tab
Select First VPN connection (optionally used to auto connect during boot)
A popup will now start trying to connect to your VPN provider. If your details are correct a list of all available servers will appear and you can select the server you wish to use as your primary VPN server
Once you have done this you will see in the settings that the Second VPN connection choice is also now available. Select it and your list of servers will appear again. When you do this Third VPN connection will become available in the VPN connections list you can keep repeating this until you have 10 default servers
Once you have these you can select the Cycle through primary VPN connections section in the add-on so you don't need to scroll through EVERY server that is available from your VPN provider
If you would like to know more about the add-on then you can read about it in the official thread on the OpenELEC website.
